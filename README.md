=========
Based on commit 9102afb63c046c4e4005e7f9fdbac48ae9505a0e from adneal/Apollo-CM.
Added new functionally: Exclude files mask for excluding files or folders. 
It was needed for me after replace internal sdcard to external. 
So I get strange situation: Dublicates albums, artists, songs and other. 
It can't fixed by adding ".nomedia" to folder, because it need to exclude whole storage (for example external sdcard).
